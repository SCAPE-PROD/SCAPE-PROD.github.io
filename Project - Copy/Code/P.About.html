                    My name is Sam (S-CAPE), I'm a small music producer from the PNW. I began producing as an outlet for channeling my creative energy and quickly became encapsulated by the process. Music has always played a significant role in my life. I am currently in college at Gonzaga University, so music is very much a side-project during the semester (hoping for it to become the <i>main</i>-project). Producing music brings me an indescribable sense of bliss and accomplishment much greater than only listening to music. I produce hardstyle, but I also don't like to limit my future-self just to one box.

                    Never be afraid to like “mysterious music”, especially in an unwelcome environment.

                        <h1>FL STUDIO</h1></a>

                    <p>I highly recommend the FL Studio Producer Edition for anyone looking to begin music production. It's not too hand-holdy but at the same time, not too intimidating. You can typically score a pretty good discount (<s>$199</s> $149) around Black Friday for all editions.</p>

                        <h1>VITAL WAVETABLE</h1></a>

                    <p>Vital is a free 3 oscillator synthesizer wavetable with many features including filters, LFOs, distortion, reverb, and more. Basically, all the stuff you need but in the form of a free alternative. It's VERY intimidating at first but can essentailly create any noise possible.</p>

                        <h1>PIONEER FLX-4 CONTROLLER</h1></a>
                    
                    <p>If you want to get into mixing with or without already producing, the FLX-4 is the way to go. It's pretty simple to get into and use but still has many effects, controls, and features for a 2-channel controller. A new one will cost around $300, but there is a thriving market of used DJ equipment.</p>
